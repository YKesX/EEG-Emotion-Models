# üß† EEG Emotion Recognition Models

_A Research Tool for Brainwave-Based Emotion Analysis_

Emotion recognition DL/ML models for EEG and multimodal variations. Currently only for DREAMER dataset. Uses LOGO.
This open-source project blends computational neuroscience and machine learning to identify human emotional states from EEG data. Built with a focus on transparency, reproducibility, and modular experimentation.

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

- üß† **Frequency Band Analysis** ‚Äî Goes trough all 5 different frequency bands and the overall signal.
- üß¨ **Many Models** ‚Äî SVM, RF, CNN, Fuzzy-CNN, Attention-Enhanced Fuzzy-CNN, Fuzzy Domain-Adversarial Network and GraphCNN.
- üìâ **Multimodal Feature Extraction** ‚Äî Includes other modalities, for now only ECG.
- üß™ **Offline** ‚Äî Analyze recorded EEG or stream from devices.

## ‚úÖ To Do

‚úÖ Adding GUI
‚úÖ Adding pausing ability
‚úÖ Adding in selection for which model to train

- [ ] Add more modalities(need more datasets)
- [ ] Real-Time EEG analysis
- [ ] Include additional datasets in `data/`
- [ ] Integrate more model variations
